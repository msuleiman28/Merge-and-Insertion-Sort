# Merge-and-Insertion-Sort
This project visualizes and sonifies sorting algorithms using StdDraw for graphics and StdAudio for sound. It includes my version of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort, where each element is represented as a colored circle, and its value determines the pitch of the sound played during sorting.
